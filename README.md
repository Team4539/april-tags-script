 A simple script to get april tag data from a USBCamera

## todo
```
- Add support for Networktables (Shuffleboard, SmartDashboard)
    - I have a function in mind, I just couldn't connect to one when I tried it
    - Make run all the time
    - Close when camera stream is closed, and start when camera stream is available
